<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alpha Notice</strong>:<br />
This tool is still under construction and in pre-release stage. Basic editing and preview features work but some of the support features like link/image embedding and code highlights from the menus are not working yet. The add-ins are also experimental only. The tool is usable as is just be extra careful with keeping backups.</p>

<p>Focus is on the editor and the preview is collapsible. The toolbar and a number of common control hotkeys provide gentle UI support for embedding Markdown expressions into your content.</p>
<p>Mostly it's about editing Markdown, and getting content created</p>
