# Markdown Monster Change Log

### 0.32
* **Update preview refresh**  
Keyboard refresh now waits for keyboard to be idle for 1 sec after typing before refreshing. This is a single check which is much more efficient and should result in less jitter and faster keyboard entry.

### 0.31
* **Fixes to MetaWebLog API Blog Publishing**  
Switched to object type and string defaults for Post and Blog ids which is more compatible with server side libraries and compatible with what Live Writer sends. Thanks to Thorsten Weggen for his help in tracking some of these issues down.
 
* **Slightly adjusted Preview Themes**  
Updated the Dharkan and Blackout themes with slightly bigger fonts and wider line spacing.

### 0.30 
* **Added better Application Updater Error Handling**  
If updates can't be download the errors are no longer blowing up MM on exit. Also there's a pre-check now that checks for connection availability.

* **Image Embedding now prompts for local path**  
When embedding a local image from a non-relative path you are now prompted if you want to copy the image to a local folder relative to the document.
