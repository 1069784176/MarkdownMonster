### Build your own Markdown Monster Add-ins
Did you know that Markdown Monster has an add-in extension model? You can easily create an add-in that adds custom functionality to Markdown Monster. You can add a button and window using your own UI and/or simply interact with the active document, hook events such when documents are loaded or saved, and modify selected text inside of a document. It's easy to do using the .NET Add-in model.
