### FontAwesome Icons
Did you know that you can easily embed FontAwesome icons into Markdown documents with @MarkdownMonstr? Simply embed @icon-iconname into your documents and MM renders the icon for you. For more sophisticated use cases you can also use raw HTML.

### Pasting Images into Content
Did you know you can paste images from the clipboard into your Markdown documents? You can capture images to the clipboard from any image program, from a Web Browser (copy image), or from a Windows Screen capture (Alt-Prtscreen). Then simply go into the editor and paste. MM will prompt where to save the image and embed it into the document.

### Build your own Markdown Monster Add-ins
Did you know that Markdown Monster has an add-in extension model? You can easily create an add-in that adds custom functionality to Markdown Monster. You can add a button and window using your own UI and/or simply interact with the active document, hook events such when documents are loaded or saved, and modify selected text inside of a document. It's easy to do using the .NET Add-in model.

### Embed Font-Awesome Icons
Did you know you can use @icon-FontAwesomeIconName to embed FontAwesome icons into your content in Markdown Monster? If your target site for HTML supports Font Awesome this syntax is a quick way to embed icons.

<div style="margin-top: 30px;font-size: 0.8em;
            border-top: 1px solid #eee;padding-top: 8px;">
    <img src="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/favicon.png"
         style="height: 20px;float: left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
    this post created with 
    <a href="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com" 
       target="top">Markdown Monster</a> 
</div>

### Html Editing
Did you know that Markdown Monster can also edit HTML files with live preview? Open an HTML document and MM will preview it and update the preview as you edit it.
