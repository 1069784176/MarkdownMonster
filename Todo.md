### Markus's List of issues

#### Enhancements
    
* [x] Allow me to search in the tree
* [ ] Commit/push all changes in the folder to Git
* [ ] FileSystemWatcher to update the tree automatically
* [x] Ctrl-Tab to switch documents
* [x] Can't the save-as dialog stay open on the same folder rather than always defaulting back to something
* [ ] Undocking tabs? :smiley:
* [x] ~~Could you somehow support Grammarly? ~~

#### Bugs 

* [ ] Drag & Drop of images does not work when one creates a new file and that file hasn't been saved yet (which makes sense, I guess... but it is very confusing and there should be a message that indicates why nothing happens)

* [ ] When adding a new file to the tree, it should show the right icon when setting the file extension
* [ ] Can I somehow see what the current zoom level is?
* [ ] When right-clicking to delete in the tree, it should delete the item I clicked on, even if a different one is selected (right now, you can accidently delete a different one if an item in the tree is selected, and then you right-click on a DIFFERENT one and pick "Delete")
* [x] Table editing in TextBox Input Masks topic (and it also has trouble with the escaped | character when escaped with a backslash)
* [ ] It's not particularly happy on very large topics (such as the "Understanding Layout" one I have)
