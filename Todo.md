### Immediate
* [ ] Addin Enabled/Disabled
* [ ] Master Configuration Form
* [ ] Markdown Document Outline
* [ ] Spell checker Dictionary Downloads
    * Store dictionaries online
    * Show what's installed
    * Show whats available
    * Link to Open Office for missing stuff

### Mid Term
* [ ] Add JavaScript {{Handlebars}} Processing to Snippets Addin

### Bugs
* [ ] Fix Folder Browser Rename/Delete file occasional locking issues.
* [ ] Fix Markdown List display where new bullet auto creates

### Consideration
* [ ] Check out ReverseMarkdown C# source - needs adjustments (lists, spacing)
* [ ] reveal.js presentations

So this is a type of text processing that occurs when you overdo it.
